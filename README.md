--Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries

  This task focused on retrieving data from the `student` table using SQL.

--What I Did:
  - Used `SELECT *`, filtered with `WHERE`, and searched with `LIKE`
  - Practiced `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `DISTINCT`, and `ORDER BY`
  - Limited results using `LIMIT` and used `AS` for aliasing

--Tools Used:
  - MySQL Workbench

--Table Used:
  - `student` with columns: student_id, student_name, student_department, email, phone_number
